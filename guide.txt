**on the firestore > rules**

write syntax is for create, update and delete


most of the times, you might want to avoid the default rules
and change that into this:

allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId
allow update, delete: if request.auth !== null
allow read: if true

explanation*
the request obj there is the request form that contains user and doc information
after submitting the handleSubmit or onClick functions on your react
note* - update and delete might not contains request.resource.data, if your not passing and formValues 

create - allow user to create if he's logged in and if he's the one who's about to create the document
update, delete - allow user to update and delete, only of he is logged in
read - all user can see and access documents of other users
